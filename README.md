#### LinkShortener.sh

The `shortlink.sh` script is a handy tool for quickly shortening URLs using the is.gd service. With a simple command, it takes a long URL as an argument, shortens it, and displays both the original and shortened links. This script simplifies the process of sharing concise links, particularly useful for character-limited platforms or improving link aesthetics.
